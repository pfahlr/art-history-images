# art-history-images


## Contributing

Images should be stored in a directory named for the movement which the work depicted in the image is representative.

I've come up with the naming convention `[artist]_[work]_[date].(ext)` but I'm not opposed to changing it if someone has a better idea.

If you can find a lossless or less compressed/higher resolution version of anything in here, please replace it. 

Not really any rules as to what counts as "art". If it's possible to find anything about the artist that wasn't posted to the web by the artist themself, then I would consider them worthy of inclusion in this collection.
